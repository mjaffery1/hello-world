My first repository
Hi my name is mohammed jaffery. I am 29 years old from Queens NY. I graduated from Baruch College. I currently work for the DOH in the Vision Program. I am looking to shift careers and get a job in programming. But first i need to learn how to code and do it well. I am engaged to my wonderful fiance and she is supporting me through this venture. I love watching movies and tv shows. I'm a fan of star wars. I also like anime. I hope i can catch on to things fast and be a quick learner so that i can get a new job and hopefully make a better salary in a field where i can always improve.
