# hello-world
My first repository
Hi my name is Mohammed Jaffery. 
I am 29 years old from Queens NY. 
I graduated from Baruch College. 
I currently work for the DOH in the Vision Program. 
I am looking to shift careers and get a job in programming. 
But first I need to learn how to code and do it well. 
I am engaged to my wonderful fiance and she is supporting me through this venture. 
I love watching movies and tv shows. 
I'm a fan of Star Wars. This is the way.
I also enjoy watching anime. 
I hope I can catch on to things fast and be a quick learner so that I can get a new job and hopefully make a better salary in a field where I can always improve.
